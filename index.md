# Welcome to Python Programming 101 course website

Welcome! Are you brand new to Python programming? We assume you're interested in learning why and how to get started with Python. Python is a popular and rapidly growing programming language, with applications in data science, software development, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. You can quickly learn Python. It's simple to use and learn programming language.

This course goal is to help you understand the fundamentals of Python and develop the skills necessary to become a competent Python programmer. It will also helps you developing design, code, test, visualize, analyz, and debugg Python programs. Furthermore, the course includes two projects that allow you to apply the programming concepts you've learned by designing Python-based solutions.

## Course Syllabus

### Module #1 – Hello Python
In this module, I'll introduce you to the general concept of programming as well as our course format. Then we'll go over the fundamentals of Python programming language and syntax and do some simple exercises. In practice, I'll go over some essential Python functions and keywords, as well as some arithmetic operations.

### Module #2 – Python Basics 
This module will teach Python data types, identify, and convert between them.  You'll learn how to define functions, pass parameters to them, and have them return data. You'll also learn how to assign data to variables. You'll learn about code reuse, code style, as well as how to use code comments effectively. Finally, you'll learn how to compare data with equality and logical operators and how to use these to create complex branching scripts with if statements.

### Module #3 – Loops in Python
This module will take you through Python loops. In particular, you'll learn how to use different loops in Python and identify and fix infinite loop errors. You'll also know about common loop errors and how to fix them.

### Module #4 – Strings, Lists and Dictionaries in Python
This module will introduce you to string manipulation techniques in Python, such as indexing, slicing, and advanced formatting. You'll also learn about more advanced data types such as lists, sets, and dictionaries. You'll learn how to use these structures to store, reference, and manipulate data, as well as how to combine them to store complex data structures.
